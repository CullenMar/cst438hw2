Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we included a small hello world application.

1) Open the hello-world.html file

2) Click on the Preview button to open a live preview pane

3) Make some changes to the file, save, watch the preview, and have fun!

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team

Theme: Donuts!
Searches look for donuts in Getty as well as the text: 'donut' in Twitter.
We used environment variables to hide keys for the APIs.
My final pushes will be overdue because I did not install btoa to my package.json and instead installed it locally-
    when I pushed to Heroku I spent more than I would like to admit learning of this mistake ;(
I will improve by learning from my mistakes!
